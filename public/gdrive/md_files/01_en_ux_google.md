## What is Google UX?

One of Google's initiatives to boost the skills of developers and people interested in application design is the UX program, which seeks that developers can develop applications that are easy to use and meet the needs of users, for it has developed a 6-month course in which they are taught to create applications that meet the standards of UX, the course is called [User Experience (UX) Design](https://www.coursera.org/professional-certificates/google-ux-design) and can be taken free of charge through your organization or individually.

### Professional Certificate

The program allows you to obtain a professional UX certificate, which allows you to demonstrate your skills in application design, the certificate is obtained at the end of the course and can be displayed on your LinkedIn profile.

### Practical Projects

One of the advantages of this course is that practical projects are done, this leads you to cement the skills that have been learned in the course, the projects are 3 and each has a process of research, design, development and presentation. These projects are individual and use the main UX design tools such as Figma and Adbobe XD.

### The entire course is divided into 7 parts, each covering a user experience design process:

1. Basic aspects of user experience design.

2. First steps in the UX design process: Empathize, define and ideate.

3. Creating page layouts and low-fidelity prototypes.

4. Conducting UX research

5. Create high fidelity prototypes and layouts in Figma.

6. Adaptive web designs in Adobe XD

7. Design a user experience of a public interest initiative and prepare the work.

### Personal opinion

I found the course very interesting and maintains an adequate learning path, it achieves the objective of providing the necessary knowledge to develop applications that meet UX standards, the course is very complete. 
Perhaps too complete, that is, there are some topics that are repeated from one case study to another and the fact of taking a design in Figma and then pass it to Adobe, could be inefficient. The designs on screens of different resolutions are reduced to mobile and desktop sizes, which is not very realistic, since in real life there are devices with intermediate resolutions.

> I have been using Figma for a long time and find it excellent for application design, but when it comes to something simple, I always go straight to style development with CSS or any design related framework.
