# Google UX Research

After reviewing the basics of user experience design and understanding the design process from ideation, comes the user experience research process. In this process we seek to understand the context of the users, their needs and problems, for this we conduct interviews, surveys and observations.

### Objective of the research

The objective of the research is to understand the context of the users, their needs and their problems, it is important that if we do not have real users, we also work with fictitious users, for this we can use the technique of fictitious people. People who represent real users and who represent our consumers, for this we must take into account the following aspects:

1. The user must have a name.

2. The user must have an age.

3. The user must have a gender.

4. The user must have a job.

5. The user must have a level of education.

6. The user must have an income level.

7. The user must have a level of qualification.

8. The user must have a level of experience.

9. The user must have a personality level.

If necessary, their beliefs or skills can also be noted. Designing fictional characters can be a long process, but it is worth it.

### Interviews

Interviews are one of the most used techniques in UX research, the interviews are conducted with the contemplated users, for this purpose the technique of in-depth interviews is used, which seeks to understand the context of users, their needs and problems, taking into account some aspects:

1. The interviewer should have a script of questions.

2. The roles of facilitator and stakeholder should be assigned.

3. The context of the users should be taken into account.

### Remarks

Observations determine users' behaviors, recording what they do, what they say and what they think. Our ability to interpret these aspects may be limited; it is necessary to contrast the data obtained from observations with those obtained from interviews. During this process, it is important to identify some biases that could affect our research process.

### Research results

Interpreting the results of the research is the most important aspect of this process, so that we can iterate our design and improve the user experience. If it is necessary to change the entire design, we should do so, but it is important to keep in mind that user experience design is an iterative process, so it is necessary to perform usability testing and iterate the design again.

### Share the results

It is important to share research results with development, design and marketing teams so that they can make decisions based on the research results.

> This part of the course is the most interesting part before the high fidelity designs, providing the designer with confidence while improving his designs.
